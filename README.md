Resources for the "Wikipedia Search Game"

The goal of the Wikipedia Game is to get from a specified starting page on Wikipedia to a specified ending page on Wikipedia, via the least amount of links as possible. You are only allowed to click on one link per page & once you access a link you cannot go back to previous links.

This program aims to win the "Wikipedia Search Game" as fast as possible.

To play, download 'wikiSearchGame.py' and run on Python 3.
